# Welcome to BandStagePlot!

## Here's a sneak peek at some exciting new features I'm working on:

* 🎁 Box creator tool: Create custom boxes of any shape and size with ease. The intuitive interface will make it easy to design and customize your stage plot exactly the way you want it.

* 🎁 Line creator tool: With the line creator tool, you can easily add lines to your stage plot to highlight important elements or create a visual flow for your band members.

* 🎁 Text box tool: Customize your stage plot with text boxes to add annotations, labels, or notes. The easy-to-use text box tool makes it simple to add text anywhere on your stage plot.

* 🎁 More instruments: I'm constantly expanding the library of instruments to help you create the most comprehensive stage plot possible. From guitars to drum kits, BandStagePlot has got you covered.

* 🎁 Scalability and rotation: Make your objects scalable and rotatable with ease. This will give you the flexibility to create a stage plot that fits your exact needs.

* 🎁 Verification, code, and payment system: To ensure the security of your designs, I'm implementing a verification, code, and payment system. This will provide you with a secure platform to create and use your stage plots.

* 🎁 Arrow key movement: Want more control over the placement of your objects? Our new arrow key movement feature will allow you to move your objects with precision using your keyboard.

## Some bug cleanup will be happening soon!

## And that's not all! I'm constantly working on new features and improvements to make Band Stage Plot the best tool for designing stage plots. Plus, if I get enough funding, I'll be working on a mobile app, which will make it even easier to design your stage plot on-the-go.
