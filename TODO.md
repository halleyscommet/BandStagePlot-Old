## Exciting New Features

### Here's a sneak peek at some exciting new features I'm working on:

<br>

* 🎁 Box creator tool: Create custom boxes of any shape and size with ease. The intuitive interface will make it easy to design and customize your stage plot exactly the way you want it.
* 🎁 Line creator tool: With the line creator tool, you can easily add lines to your stage plot to highlight important elements or create a visual flow for your band members.
* 🎁 Text box tool: Customize your stage plot with text boxes to add annotations, labels, or notes. The easy-to-use text box tool makes it simple to add text anywhere on your stage plot.
* 🎁 More instruments: I'm constantly expanding the library of instruments to help you create the most comprehensive stage plot possible. From guitars to drum kits, BandStagePlot has got you covered.
* 🎁 Scalability and rotation: Make your objects scalable and rotatable with ease. This will give you the flexibility to create a stage plot that fits your exact needs.
* 🎁 Verification, code, and payment system: To ensure the security of your designs, I'm implementing a verification, code, and payment system. This will provide you with a secure platform to create and use your stage plots.
* 🎁 Arrow key movement: Want more control over the placement of your objects? Our new arrow key movement feature will allow you to move your objects with precision using your keyboard.

## Bug Fixes

### Some bug cleanup will be happening soon!

And that's not all! I'm constantly working on new features and improvements to make Band Stage Plot the best tool for designing stage plots. Plus, if I get enough funding, I'll be working on a mobile app, which will make it even easier to design your stage plot on-the-go.
